# Lambda Calculus Expression Interpreter in Java
This interpreter of lambda calculus expressions was written in Java and uses the ANTLR parser generator.  This interpreter was written for the purposes of instructing students taking CS 152 (Programming Paradigms, a course on programming language paradigms and principles) at San José State University in California.

For learning the rules of interpreting lambda calculus expressions, I recommend
reading page 146 of _Formal Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages: A Laboratory Based Approach_ by Kenneth Slonneger and Barry L. Kurtz, which can be found in Chapter 5 [here](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~slonnegr/plf/Book/).

# Dependencies
 * Java 1.8 or greater
 * ANTLR 4.8.  Please follow the instructions on the [ANTLR Quick Start page](https://www.antlr.org), including setting up the `CLASSPATH` and the aliases.

# How to Build
These build instructions should work on any Unix system:

```
antlr4 -no-listener -visitor LambdaExpr.g4
javac *.java
```

`cleanup.sh` is a very helpful script for removing class files and files generated by ANTLR.

# Usage
LambdaCalculusInterpreter reads in a single lambda calculus expression from standard input.  It requires an EOF symbol in order for it to stop reading and to start parsing and interpreting the expression.

# Usage Examples
```
$ echo x | java LambdaCalculusInterpreter
x

$ echo "(^x.x y)" | java LambdaCalculusInterpreter
y

$ echo "(^x.x (^y.y z))" | java LambdaCalculusInterpreter debug
Parse tree output: (lexpr ( (lexpr ^ x . (lexpr x)) (lexpr ( (lexpr ^ y .
(lexpr y)) (lexpr z) )) ))
AST is : (λx.x (λy.y z))
(λy.y z)
z
```
